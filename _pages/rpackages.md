Part of my work involves creating `R` packages. I am particularly inrerested in creating `R` packages for work in political science.
Feel free to check out (and use!) my software.


* [`readabs`](https://zmeers.github.io/readabs/), a `R`package for reading Microsoft excel files from the Australian Bureau of Statistics

* [`ggparliament`](https://github.com/RobWHickman/ggparliament), a `ggplot2` extension for parliament plots.


As always, if you find any bug please log an issue on the respective GitHub repositories and I will get to them as soon as possible.
