Feel free to check out (and use!) my software.


* [`readabs`](https://github.com/MattCowgill/readabs), a `R`package for reading Microsoft Excel files from the Australian Bureau of Statistics into tidy data frames.

* [`ggparliament`](https://github.com/RobWHickman/ggparliament), a `ggplot2` extension for parliament plots.

I appreciate feedback. If you have any comments with regards to my `R` packages, email me at zoe.meers@gmail.com.
