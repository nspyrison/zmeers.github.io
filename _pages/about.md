I am the 2018 [Google News Lab Fellow](https://newslab.withgoogle.com/fellowship) with the Interactive Digital Stories team at ABC News. Additionally, I work for Professor Simon Jackman as a Research Assistant at the [US Studies Center at Sydney University](https://ussc.edu.au). I create data visualization pieces using a variety of tools, including R, D3.js, and React.js. I also work on academic projects in political science, particularly in the quantitative realm. 

In the past five years, I have lived in Costa Rica, the United States, Kenya, France, and Australia. I am a news junkie, enjoy card games, and I speak fluent French as well as conversational Spanish.
