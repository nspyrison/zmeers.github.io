I am the 2018 [Google News Lab Fellow](https://newslab.withgoogle.com/fellowship) with the Interactive Digital Stories team at ABC News. Additionally, I work for Professor Simon Jackman as a Research Assistant at the [United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney](https://ussc.edu.au). I create data visualization pieces using a variety of tools, including R, D3.js, and React.js. I have written for the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/25/we-finally-know-the-results-of-papua-new-guineas-elections/?utm_term=.a1cc038a4649) and [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-19/donald-trump-remains-popular-with-republicans-after-a-year/9333378). I also work on academic projects in political science, particularly in the quantitative realm. 

In the past five years, I have lived in Costa Rica, the United States, Kenya, France, and Australia. I am a news junkie, enjoy card games, and I speak fluent French as well as conversational Spanish.
