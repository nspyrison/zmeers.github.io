I am currently a Google News Lab Fellow at ABC News. Additionally I work for Professor Simon Jackman as a Research Assistant at the US Studies Center at Sydney University. Primarily I create data visualization pieces using a variety of tools, including R, D3.js, and React.js. I also work on academic projects in political science.
