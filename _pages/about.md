I am one of the 2018 Australian [Google News Lab Fellows](https://newslab.withgoogle.com/fellowship) with the Interactive Digital Stories team at ABC News. I create data visualizations using a variety of tools, including R, Python, and D3.js. I have written for [*The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/25/we-finally-know-the-results-of-papua-new-guineas-elections/?utm_term=.a1cc038a4649) and [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-19/donald-trump-remains-popular-with-republicans-after-a-year/9333378). 

Additionally, I work as a Research Assistant for Professor Simon Jackman at the [United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney](https://ussc.edu.au). Broadly speaking, I study public opinion polling to analyze the political behavior of the mass public. I am also interested in the spread of (mis)information during election campaigns and how that influences behavior and attitudes of voters.

I graduated from [Smith College](https://smith.edu) in May 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in Government and a minor in Statistics and Data Science. Born and raised in Australia, I have since spent most of my adult life abroad in Costa Rica, the United States, France, and Kenya.
