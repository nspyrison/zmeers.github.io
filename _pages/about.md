Hello, world!

I currently work as a Data Visualization Analysist at the [United States Studies Center](https://www.ussc.edu.au/) at the [University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/). Previously, I was one of the 2018 Australian [Google News Initative Fellows](newslab.withgoogle.com/fellowship) with the ABC News Lab. I create data visualization pieces using a variety of tools, including `R`, `Python`, and `D3.js`. Additionally, I work as a Research Assistant in political science and other quantitative social science disciplines.

I am an `R` package developer, having created [readabs](http://zmeers.github.io/readabs/), a package that reads Excel files from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Right now, I am working on [ggparliament](https://github.com/robWHickman/ggparliament), a `ggplot2` extension for visualizing legislatures. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of statistics and political behavior. Broadly speaking, I study comparative public opinion and political behavior, with a focus on the United States and Australia. I also have a keen interest in the Pacific region, particularly Small Island Developing States. 

Some of the research projects I have worked on including measuring political knowledge, case studies of refugees in Paris, an analysis of climate change refugees in the Pacific, and a pre-election survey of US college students from September to November, 2016.

I have written for The Monkey Cage at [*The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/25/we-finally-know-the-results-of-papua-new-guineas-elections/?utm_term=.a1cc038a4649) and [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-19/donald-trump-remains-popular-with-republicans-after-a-year/9333378). 

I graduated from [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu) in May 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in [Government](https://www.smith.edu/gov/) and a minor in [Statistics and Data Science](https://www.smith.edu/sds/). Born and raised in Australia, I have since spent most of my adult life abroad in Costa Rica, the United States, France, and Kenya.
