I am currently a Google News Lab Fellow at ABC News. 

I am also a Research Assistant for Professor Simon Jackman at the US Studies Center at Sydney University.

I work on data visualization projects using a variety of tools, including front-end web development and Javascript packages like D3. 

I also hack my way around R, cleaning data. 

I am passionate about using data and statistics to explain *why* certain events occur in the political sphere. I also work on academic projects in political science.
